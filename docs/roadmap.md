# RUSTWATER — The Roadmap

> **There is ONE roadmap (this file) and ONE handoff ([`NEXT-AGENT.md`](NEXT-AGENT.md)),
> and they work hand-in-hand:** this doc owns *what gets built and in what order*; the handoff
> owns *where we are right now / pick-up-here*. The treatment owns *what the game is*. No other
> roadmap/plan/TODO files — fold and delete, never accrete (owner rule).

> **Direction (owner, 2026-06-11):** the design canon is [`rustwater-treatment.md`](rustwater-treatment.md)
> — a cyberpunk-western open-world RPG (Ezra Cross, the Meridian Territory, the Executor). The
> shipped WestWard engine + Dustward world are its **substrate**: re-skin and extend progressively,
> playable at every commit, nothing tested rewritten from scratch. Public title stays WestWard
> until the vertical slice exists.

**Companion guides (NOT roadmaps — reference, kept):** [`rustwater-treatment.md`](rustwater-treatment.md)
(design canon) · [`map-editing-guide.md`](map-editing-guide.md) (world layout/coords/`__spike` hooks) ·
[`3d-art-direction.md`](3d-art-direction.md) (composition) · [`art-bible.md`](art-bible.md) (quality bar) ·
[`water-plan.md`](water-plan.md) (the Meridian water system).

Last updated: `2026-06-18` · main green at **896 vitest** · live: westward-rpg.vercel.app (the
Believability Pass is deployed) · play: `npm run play` → :5191.

## Where we are (status of the milestones below)

- **Believability Pass (Westward look) — ✅ SHIPPED + DEPLOYED.** Naturalistic PBR town, golden-hour
  IBL, wet/puddle street, water-tower cathedral, cyber-aging, town life, golden-hour boot. Dusk
  golden baseline re-blessed to match.
- **M0 Performance — 🟡 IN PROGRESS.** Done: route-sage flora → `InstancedMesh`, distance-cull far
  flora, shared contact-shadow material, shadow-lag fix (`shadowMap.autoUpdate=false`). Remaining:
  merged/instanced town geometry, the **<400 draw-call ceiling in CI**, the reduced-fidelity WebGL2
  demotion. (Owner: fill the foreground perf table below.)
- **World-Aliveness (R1) — ✅ COMPLETE.** Motion + sound + biome identity + occupancy all shipped:
  windmills, tumbleweeds, bird flocks, flora sway, lamp flicker, chimney smoke, walking NPCs that go
  home after dark, the full audio layer, road-verge scatter, per-biome flora tint, the Eastwater
  cattle paddock (grazing) + horses, and the dusk owl cue. Every motion system is `fdt`-gated
  (frozen under the `?visual` capture → golden-safe).

## ▶ NOW — the Playable Slice (owner reset, 2026-06-18)

**New top priority: a polished 5-minute RPG slice with the architecture of a larger game** — not more
world. The world is dressed; what's missing is *RPG feel*. Full audit: [`../SYSTEM_AUDIT.md`](../SYSTEM_AUDIT.md).
Diagnosis: the opening already has a full arc (funeral → town → bounty → slime → return) but reads as
a guided tutorial — the job comes from a *sign*, not a person, and the arc ends on a fizzle. Fix it
with a small dialogue/mission primitive on the clean systems we already have. **No god-file rewrite,
no world changes, no new deps.**

- **M-Slice-1 — "A Voice, a Job, a Payoff" (FIRST, in progress).** The opening bounty is *given by a
  character* via a short conversation and ends with a real "BOUNTY COMPLETE" beat (reward + a hook),
  not a teaser. Clone `boardModal`/`boardDom` → a tiny dialogue modal; conversation + completion lines
  as DATA; wire at the existing board beat + the return beat. Golden-safe (hidden UI, no town
  geometry). The biggest visible RPG-feel leap, small + reversible.
- **M-Slice-2 — mission-as-data seed.** Lift the opening's name/objective/reward/completion into a
  small `mission` data object + thin runner that frames the existing FSM beats (no FSM rewrite).
- **M-Slice-3 — one more talkable NPC** with a real (data) conversation + a second short objective —
  proves the dialogue/mission pattern scales.
- **M-Struct-1 — god-file decomposition, increment 1** (the deferred #6 below): extract `build*`
  builders → `src/render3d/build/`. Do AFTER the slice, incrementally, broad-capture-verified.

Then resume world build-out (Folly/Wash spurs, Crossline region, wildlife) once the slice feels good.

---

## Shipped 2026-06-18 night — world build-out + polish (golden-safe, dusk PASS <0.13%)

These landed before the slice reset; kept for reference.

**World build-out** — ✅ all four shipped (each PASS <0.13% on the dusk gate):
1. ✅ **The Drift — exploration POIs** (`00af151`). 3 ride-to-discover beats (downed satellite /
   sealed vault / machine graveyard) east of the wagon, dressed from existing model kinds +
   loot/lore (`poiSystem` + `DRIFT_BADLANDS`).
2. ✅ **Road ruts** (`fb960cb`). Worn two-track (rutMat + centre wear) on the whole OPEN_RANGE_ROADS
   network via the existing `addRoadPlane` idiom.
3. ✅ **Eastwater ranch** (`59fc2af`). It was already richly dressed — added the missing paddock
   enclosure (north + west fence line). (Crossline Ranch as a *separate* family-seat region is still
   unbuilt — a future world item.)
4. ✅ **Calico cyber dressing** (`2b1aa5d`). Two skyline comms masts + a steel-mustang landmark to
   thicken the free town's thin cyber layer.

**Polish:**
5. ✅ **Per-time-of-day env intensity** (`f7e5da2`). `palette.envIntensity` (day 1.12 / goldenHour
   1.0 / dusk 0.9-pinned / night 0.5) carried through `lerpPalette`, written in `applyPalette`.
6. ⬜ **God-file extraction — DEFERRED (next focused session, not a rushed overnight pass).**
   `spike.js` is ~5,300 lines. The `claude/module-split` branch is **stale/irrelevant** (reviewed:
   it splits the long-deleted legacy `game.js`, not spike.js — ignore it). Do it FRESH and
   **incrementally**: the high-value target is the builder fleet (`buildX(group,p)`, lines ~339–1503)
   → `src/render3d/build/` modules, but they're coupled through `standard()` + the grounded-material
   machinery + cross-calls + the `buildPlacement` dispatch, so move them in small batches. **The dusk
   golden gate only covers the town view** — verify each batch byte-stable with a BROADER fast-capture
   sweep (town + open_range + marsh + Calico via `__spike.setPos`), not just the dusk frame. Leaf
   builders with the fewest deps first (e.g. flora/rock/cactus already partly in `world/`); the
   grounded-material `standard()` + `_groundedTownBuild` flag is the trickiest seam — extract it last
   or pass it in explicitly.

**Next world items after #6** (agent-buildable dressing, prompt Boyd for any naming/lore): the
north spur → Prospector's Folly + the south spur → Sunken Wash read thin; Crossline Ranch as a
distinct family-seat region; more Drift POIs (it's meant to be bounty country); wildlife in the open
range.

Pick top-down; re-bless dusk only if a change deliberately moves it (eyeball first).

## The carry-over map (nothing gets rebuilt)

| Shipped WestWard system | RUSTWATER role |
|---|---|
| `src/jobBoard.js` + board modal UI | Main missions, faction chains, the **bounty office** (infinite procedural board) |
| `src/render3d/questRuntime.js` | Generic quest wiring for all mission taxonomies |
| `src/npcMemory.js` | Relationships → courtship → **marriage/family** events |
| `shopCatalog` + `tradeWithVendor` + `economyServices` | **Businesses** (saloon/stable/water-hauling/print shop…) |
| `src/gearCrafting.js` | **Augments/Iron** (slots: eyes/arms/spine/heart/neural) |
| `src/progressionSystem.js` | The five trees: **GUN / IRON / WIRE / TONGUE / TRAIL** |
| `src/render3d/gameState.js` | The three meters: **Cash / Standing / Legend** |
| `frontierLayout.js` + `biomeAt`/`biome.js` + the town kit | **Meridian regions** — Dustward → Calico Flats; Providence/Caldera/Drift/Crossline on the same tooling |
| Slime + `encounterSystem` | **Feral machines** (the Drift) — same FSM, new skin |
| `worldClock` / weather / `savePersistence` (ironman) | Unchanged |
| First-road loop (`phaseState.js`) | Playable spine until M1 missions replace it beat-for-beat (tripwire: `render3d-phase-state.test.ts`) |

## The milestones

### M0 — Performance reset (finish it)
Draw-call-bound: full fidelity is WebGPU-only; the WebGL2 fallback demotes to reduced mode (halved
scatter/weather, no shadow casters) instead of dictating the architecture. Batch the world
(`InstancedMesh` scatter/flora/ruts — done for flora; town geometry next), shadow + distance culling.
**Targets: ≥5× frame-time, <400 draw calls in town, locked by a CI draw-call ceiling.** Foreground
perf table (owner fills from a real Chrome tab — the preview throttles and lies):

| Pose | ms/120f | Draw calls | Shadow casters | Notes |
|------|---------|------------|----------------|-------|
| town (9.5, 8.5) | _TBD_ | _TBD_ | _TBD_ | owner: foreground Chrome |
| open_range (60, 12) | _TBD_ | _TBD_ | _TBD_ | owner: foreground Chrome |
| marsh (48, 16) | _TBD_ | _TBD_ | _TBD_ | owner: foreground Chrome |

### M1 — Meridian vertical slice (missions 1.1–1.3, playable)
Act 1 opening, replacing the first-road loop beat-for-beat. **1.1 Dust to Dust** (funeral + implant +
first Executor convo — the graveside cold-open already partly exists). **1.2 The Reading** (will +
holdings tour + holdings UI). **1.3 Lord of the Manor** (the skimming saloon manager — first
witnessed morality fork). Plus the Calico dressing pass + smart-link revolver v0. Tripwire:
`render3d-phase-state.test.ts` stays green until the mission machine replaces the loop.

### M2 — Systems of wealth
Cash / Standing / Legend on gameState (+ HUD chips) · Trouble engine v0 (events scaled by Cash ×
Legend) · Businesses v1 (saloon gossip→leads + bounty office) on shopCatalog/economyServices/jobBoard.

### M3 — Act 1 complete, through the Seizure
Missions 1.4–1.8 · Providence skeleton (the Helios spire) · Director Vance · **The Seizure** with the
five-asset choice branching Act 2's economy.

### M4+ — The wide game
Act 2 faction lines · romance chains (npcMemory) · augments (gearCrafting) · full skill trees ·
Caldera/Drift regions · the Hearing · Act 3 Water War · four endings. **Art-craft track** rides here:
art-bible as the single quality source → UV/textured `.glb` proven on the WebGL2 backend → a
Mixamo-hybrid character as the first full proof → per-region kits. Sequenced against the treatment's
owner-design backlog.

**North star (post-M4, not a sprint target):** an event-sourced `(seed, input-log)` world that
streams Elder-Scrolls-scale in a browser — radiant systems, a creation kit, optional MMO ghosts. It's
the horizon the architecture already points at, not the plan.

---

## Owner-canon vs agent-buildable (so nobody improvises the story)
- **Owner-design-required (prompt Boyd):** Act 2 mission beats, the Seizure script, all four endings,
  the Hearing verdict; economy math (the debt number, water-share prices, business income); the eight
  romance arcs; the five skill trees' perks/costs; region/character NAMES and lore.
- **Agent-buildable (just do it, golden-safe + gate-green):** regions as world dressing (POIs,
  landmarks, props, ambient life, biome identity), batching/perf, UI on existing engines, polish.

## Standing rules
- Every commit: green gate (vitest · tsc · build) + golden-safe (dusk frame held, or deliberate
  re-bless eyeballed first) + playable game.
- Engine modules extend in place; the carry-over map is binding. `HERO_OBJECTS`/`FIRST_FIVE_ROUTE`
  untouched until M1 replaces the loop. `firstFrameSlabBlockers === []`. Layout floors only rise.
- The treatment is owner-authored — design questions go to Boyd, not into improvisation.
- Deploy is the owner's call (one WebGPU verify + any dusk re-bless, then push).
